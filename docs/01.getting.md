## Getting Gource

There are several ways to get Gource. Which one is best for you depends on your operating system and your preferences.

### Installing Gource

Gource is available for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.

On most distributions, Gource is available through the package manager.

#### On Linux

```bash
# Alpine
apk add gource 

# Arch Linux
pacman -S gource 

# Debian / Kali Linux / Ubuntu / Windows WSL2 / etc.
apt-get install gource 

# Fedora
dnf install gource 
```

<sup>source: https://command-not-found.com/gource </sup>

#### On macOS

Gource can be installed on macOS using [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) or [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/).

```bash
# Homebrew
brew install gource 

# MacPorts
sudo port install gource 
```

<sup>source: https://github.com/acaudwell/Gource/wiki/Mac-Support </sup>

#### On Windows

To use natively on Windows, Gource can be installed using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/).

```bash
choco install gource 
```
<sup>source https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/gource </sup>

For those whom cannot (or do not want to) use Chocolatey, a Windows installer can be downloaded from the [latest release page](https://github.com/acaudwell/Gource/releases/latest)

At the time of this writing that is `gource-0.53`:

- https://github.com/acaudwell/Gource/releases/download/gource-0.53/gource-0.53.win64-setup.exe

It is also possible to install Gource on Windows using [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).

```sh
sudo apt-get install gource
```
### Using Docker

There are also several unofficial Docker images.

The most popular (and most up-to-date) are

- [Envisaged](https://hub.docker.com/r/utensils/envisaged) - 
https://github.com/utensils/Envisaged
- [Envisaged Redux](https://hub.docker.com/r/cartoonman/envisaged-redux) - https://gitlab.com/Cartoonman/Envisaged-Redux/

After doing a `docker pull`, Gource can be run using `docker run`:

```sh
docker pull utensils/envisaged
docker run --rm -it \
    --name 'envisaged' \
    --port 8080:80 \
    --volume /path/to/your/repo:/visualization/git_repos:ro \
    utensils/envisaged
```
or
```sh
docker pull cartoonman/envisaged-redux
docker run --rm -it \
    --name 'envisaged-redux' \
    --port 8080:80 \
    --volume /path/to/your/repo:/visualization/resources/vcs_source:ro \
    cartoonman/envisaged-redux:latest
```

Both projects have more convenient ways to run Gource, for full details see their documentation.

### Install from source

To get the latest version in development, Gource can also be build from source. It follows the standard [autotools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system) build process:

```bash
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install
```

Full details are beyond the scope of this article, but can be found the [INSTALL](https://github.com/acaudwell/Gource/blob/HEAD/INSTALL) file.
