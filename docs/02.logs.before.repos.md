# Creating an organisation-wide gource animation

## Preparations before creating logs

### Cloning all repositories

To create log files, Gource needs something to create log files _from_.

As the goal is to create an animation of all repositories of an organisation, we need local copies of those repositories first.

Cloning all repositories in a GitHub or GitLab organisation manually can take a lot of work. To make this easier, [one of these scripts](https://gist.github.com/Potherca/9dd4306eb27cad26d27874acd4b31376) can be used to clone all repositories in a GitHub or GitLab organisation at once.

Once the scripts are downloaded, they can be run like this:

```sh
sUrl='https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Potherca/9dd4306eb27cad26d27874acd4b31376/raw'

# Clone all repositories from a GitHub organisation
wget "${sUrl}/gitlab-clone-projects.bash"
bash ./github-clone-projects.bash 'github.com' "${ORGANISATION}" "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"

# or from a GitLab organisation
wget "${sUrl}/github-clone-projects.bash"
bash ./gitlab-clone-projects.bash 'gitlab.com' "${ORGANISATION}" "${GITLAB_TOKEN}"
```

The script has a `--dry-run` flag, which can be used to see what repositories would be cloned without actually cloning them.

Once the script has finished, all repositories will be cloned locally into a directory named after the organisation.

To keep to the suggested directory structure, that directory should be renamed to `repos/`.

```sh
mv "${ORGANISATION}" repos
```

Be sure to remove any repositories that should not be included in the animation.
